get the data
get the epctrum
think how to get cross correlation matrix between the stations - the struggle - this changes in time as minute resolution data
dynamic/changing network
correlating lag - function of lag
lots of data
threshold value that will change
then networks

step 1 undestand cross correlation
create a spectrum of each power series 
cross correlation as a function of time of a pair
one station is a vector - they are correlated as a value

there are more ways to do this
have bandpassed freauency before hand

how can you calculate correlation? wavelets, shared info between signals, fourier version, mutual information

phase correlations/cohenrence

share this out amongst us one person looks at each thing
get something working 

make test signals e.g. sign waves - do things we understand like simple shit

do all this then networks

presentation - take stuff from papaer, cite it
take some graphs from website, get pdfs etc
maybe use a video idk 
show a graph of where the stations are
pictrure of magnetosphere
what is a magnetometer? 
lots of pretty pictures on google
space storm
living reviews space weather




Rough plan of presentation

Whart the data is - eg like stiuff from the sun
received at magnetometers
show where they all are on a picture

show source of data
example of an event

build network from the data
complications

why this is imporant?
predictive model is goal.
