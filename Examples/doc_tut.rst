Documentation Tutorial
======================

We are using the Numpy standard of documentation in our functions. The style guidelines can be found at https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/. Essentially just follow the template, capitalize the beginnings of phrases, and put a period at the end of each statement- even if they're not full sentences.
We are using Sphinx to build the documentation. You can get Sphinx .. _here: http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/installation.html.
